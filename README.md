> This repository is a collection of all my lecture notes on computer science and maths together with some scripts for managing them and improve the note-taking experience using Vim and LaTeX.

## Brief overview
The main idea motivating this project is to have a centralized and efficient note-taking system for the different courses I take on both computer science and math. To achieve this, I'm using LaTeX along with the Vim editor for writing the notes and some Python scripts to perform repetitive tasks such as compiling or creating the necessary files for a new course. Furthermore, third-party software like Rofi and Sxhkd help in other tasks such as rapidly search and open the notes for a specific course or quickly opening the notes in Vim.

## Getting started
You can quickly begin tweaking the notes or whatever you want to do with them by running
```bash
bash <curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rixsilverith/lecture-notes/master/setup>
```
This will guide you through the installation process of the different dependencies of the project.

> Note: This note-taking environment has been designed to work on a Linux system and has only been tested on Arch Linux. Some software may not be available for your system or the configuration may vary. For this reason is recommended to build this setup step by step.

## Course structure
In order to properly tweak the lecture notes or write your own ones using this setup you should first get familiar with how is a course structured. Each course has its own folder with a unique name in the **courses** folder, which is organized as follows.
```
courses
├── analysis-1
├── analysis-2
│   ├── info.yaml
│   ├── master.tex
│   ├── topic_01.tex
│   ├── topic_02.tex
│   ├── ...
│   ├── bibliography.bib
│   └── figures
│       ├── divergence-theorem.svg
│       ├── divergence-theorem.pdf_tex
│       ├── divergence-theorem.pdf
│       └── ...
├── computer-structure
├── electromagnetism
├── linear-algebra
├── ...
```

`info.yaml` contains information about the course. More concisely, the title, short and group for that course. This file is automatically generated when initializing a new course by running `lnm init` script. The following is an example of an `info.yaml` file.
```yaml
title: Analysis II
short: AN2
group: 219
```

`master.tex` bundles up all the topics of the course into a single `.tex` file, which is compiled afterwards. It is also automatically generated and new topic are also imported by their own. To create a new topic run `lnm new-topic <course>`.

`bibliography.bib` contains all the bibliography entries used in the notes using the BibTeX format. By default, bibliography is not included in the notes (see [lecturenotes class options]() for more info).


## Custom LaTeX packages and document classes

## Managing the notes with Python scripts
First things first, begin by cloning this repo in your machine. The key here is `lnotes.sh`, which is the main entry point for most of the scripts located in the **scripts** folder and therefore the file which will act as our *lecture notes manager*.

```bash
./lnotes.sh <script> [<args>...]
```

A complete list of scripts is available by running `./lnotes.sh help` in your terminal.

#### Compiling the notes
The LaTeX compiler used by default is `latexmk`. If wanted, another compiler may be used by changing the `latex.compiler` key in the `config.yaml` file. The different arguments passed to the compiler can also be modified there with the `latex.compiler_arguments` key.

These lecture notes can be compiled by running the `compile` script as follows.
```bash
./lnotes.sh compile [course]
```
where the `course` optional argument is the name of the folder in which the `info.yaml` and `.tex` files of the course are located. If no `course` argument is passed all the courses will be compiled by default. The resulting `.pdf` file for each course can be found inside its corresponding folder.

An dark version of the lecture notes can be compiled by adding the `--dark` flag to this command or setting the `theme` key in `config.yaml` to `dark` to do it by default.

*Tip: Use the `watch` script to automatically recompile the notes when saving changes while editing the `.tex` files.*
```bash
./lnotes.sh watch <course>
```

## Improving the note-taking environment

## Commands
Command | Description
--- | ---
`compile [course]` | Compile the `.tex` files of the specified course to `.pdf`. If no course is <br> entered all will be compiled by default. The compiler, as well as the compilation <br> options can be changed by modifying the `compiler` key in the `config.yaml` file. <br><br> A dark version of the notes can be compiled by adding the `--dark` flag to this <br> command or setting the `theme` key in `config.yaml` to `dark` to do it by default, <br> and viceversa with the `--light` flag.
`fetch [repo-url]` | Fetch the latest commits from the specified repo (which should follow a similar <br> structure to this one) to your local clone. If the `repo-url` argument is not passed <br> the command  will use the repo in the `repo_url` key in the `config.yaml` file.
`help` | Show all available commands.
`info <course>` | Get information about a specific course.
`init` | Initialize a new course.
`list` | List all courses in the **courses** folder.
`push [course]` | Upload the compiled version in `.pdf` of the notes to Google Drive. The lecture <br> notes from a single course can be individually uploaded if specified.
`watch <course>` | Watch for changes in the `.tex` files of the specified course to automatically <br> recompile the notes.

## Configuration
The behaviour of some scripts can be changed by modifying the `config.yaml` file in the root of this project. This is an example of how this file looks like:
<!--
```yaml
pdf_viewer: zathura
theme: light
compiler:
    compiler_name: latexmk
    options: -shell-escape -synctex=1 -pdf -silent -interaction=nonstopmode -pvc
```

<center>
<h5>General settings</h5>

Key | Description
--- | ---
`pdf_viewer` | Executable of the PDF viewer to open the compiled lecture notes. Zathura <br> is a strong recommendation and the default here, as it implements a *dark mode*, <br> Vim shortcuts and reloads the current PDF file if it is modified. The latter is specially <br> useful when editing the `.tex` files.
`theme` | If set to `dark` a *dark version* of the notes will be compiled by default.

<h5>LaTeX compiler settings</h5>

This settings go under the `compiler` key.

Key | Description
--- | ---
`compiler_name` | The LaTeX compiler that will output the PDF files. Default: `latexmk`.
`options` | List of compiler options.

<h5>Google Drive settings</h5>

This settings go under the `g_drive` key.

Key | Description
--- | ---
`compiler_name` | The LaTeX compiler that will output the PDF files. Default: `latexmk`.
`options` | List of compiler options.

</center>

<!--
In order to compile the corresponding LaTeX files for each course you can make use of the `compile.sh` script. By default, it will compile the lecture notes from all courses. However, you can compile the lecture notes from a specific course by passing the short for that course or the name of its folder as an argument, as well as the output directory (default: **lecture-notes/out**). A list of all courses and their shorts is available by running the `list_courses.sh` script. Example:
```bash
./compile.sh --course=CSTRUCT --out-dir=~/Uni/lecture-notes/
```

It's also recommended to use `latexmk` to continuously compile the lecture notes while editing them.
```bash
latexmk -shell-escape -synctex=1 -pdf -silent -interaction=nonstopmode -pvc <file.tex>
```
About the arguments: `-shell-escape` let us create LaTeX subprocesses to compile auxiliary files; `-synctex=1` generates a `synctex.gz` file that let certain PDF viewers (Skim in macOS, Okular in Linux and Sumatra in Windows) to relate a position in the PDF with its corresponding part in the `.tex` file; `-silent` reduces the output of the compiler; `-interaction=nonstopmode` prevents the compiler from stopping when it spots an error; finally, `-pvc` enables continuous compilation when saving the `.tex` file.
