\bchapter{The Riemann integral}

Just like series and derivatives, integrals are also one of the fundamentals of calculus, and like them,
they are built upon limits. The main application of integrals is computing areas and volumes. However,
they can also be used to test a series for convergence or get the original function from a derivative, known
as the antiderivative. Moreover, they are necessary for solving differential equations (which this course
does not cover).

\begin{defi}[Partition]
    A partition $\Pi_n$ of an interval $[a, b]$ is a set composed by a finite number of points $\Pi_n = \{
    x_i\}_{i=0}^n$ such that
    \begin{equation}
        a = x_0 < x_1 < \ldots < x_{n - 1} < x_n = b.
    \end{equation}
\end{defi}
