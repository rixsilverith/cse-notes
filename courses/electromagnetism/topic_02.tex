\chapter{Electrostatic field}

In this chapter we are studying the electrostatic field both in the vaccum and matter taking into account point
charges and continuous distribution of charges.

\section{The electromagnetic interaction}
The electromagnetic interaction is one of the four fundamental interactions of nature. It describes all electric and
magnetic phenomena in nature and, contrary to what it might seem, it's way stronger than the gravitational interaction.

Electric charges are manifested through electric and magnetic fields, which are closely related. The electromagnetic force
is responsible of phenomena such as the cohesion and structure of matter, electric currents, electromagnetic radiation, etc.

\begin{defn}[Electric charge]
    The electric charge is a fundamental property of matter. A certain particle has charge or not. Electromagnetism is an
    interaction between charges particles. A particle has charge when it interacts electromagnetically.
\end{defn}

An important characteristic of the forces that interact in nature is that they act between separated particles in
space. To understand this kind of forces the concept of \textit{field} is introduced.
